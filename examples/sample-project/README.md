This project shows off features of ml-gradle and ml-app-deployer that aren't demonstrated in any of the other 
projects in the examples directory.

To try it out, just run "gradle -i mlDeploy" (the Gradle "-i" flag includes any logging at the INFO level, which is
helpful to see what ml-gradle is doing). You can then run the tests in src/test/java by running "gradle test", or
just inspect everything that was created via the ML Admin app.
