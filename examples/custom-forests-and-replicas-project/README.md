This project shows an example of configuring any forests and replicas you'd like for a database. See
the forests/custom-forest-example-content directory.

Note that you'll need to run this against a cluster with at least two nodes (failover requires three nodes, but you
only need two nodes to see how ml-gradle will create replica forests).
